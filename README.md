## About Me
I am a first-year MSc Artificial Intelligence student at **Carnegie Mellon University Africa** with a strong background in **full-stack systems, cloud infrastructure, and applied machine learning**. My work focuses on building **end-to-end AI systems** that are not only accurate, but also **deployable in real-world, resource-constrained environments**.

I am particularly interested in:
- Computer Vision for real-world applications
- NLP usecase in Africa
- Edge AI and efficient model deployment
- AI systems bridging research and production
- Sustainable and socially impactful AI (especially in Africa)

My long-term goal is to transition from building AI-powered products to contributing **research that advances practical AI deployment** at scale.
